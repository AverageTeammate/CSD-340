        <h2>Introduction to Jacob Cannamela</h2>

        <p class="intro">I grew up in the small town of Waxhaw, North Carolina, just outside the bustling city of Charlotte. Although I loved the quiet charm of my hometown, I quickly grew to dislike the chaos and heavy traffic of the city whenever I visited. Those experiences made me appreciate the peaceful life in Waxhaw even more.</p>
        
        <p>At the age of 15, I got my first job at Dominos Pizza, which taught me the value of hard work and responsibility. Unfortunately, during this time, I broke my ankle skateboarding, which sidelined me from delivering pizzas. <span id="firstSpan">_________</span> was always an interest of mine, but I never thought it would become my career. A regular customer, who I often gave discounts to, took pity on my situation and suggested I try IT for his company in the city. That opportunity changed everything for me.</p>
        
        <p>In 2014, I did a one-day trial run at the customer’s company and was hired as a part-time intern the very next day. That role sparked my passion for <span id="secondSpan">_________</span> and opened doors I never imagined. Fast forward to today, and I now work in <span id="thirdSpan">_________</span> as a Threat Detection Engineer, with a decade of experience in the IT industry. It’s been an incredible journey of growth and <span id="fourthSpan">_________</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work, my hobbies revolve around spending quality time with my family and exploring the latest advancements in technology. Both give me a sense of purpose and excitement as I continue to pursue new challenges and opportunities.</p>
