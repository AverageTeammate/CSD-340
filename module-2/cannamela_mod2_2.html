        <h2>Introduction to Jacob Cannamela</h2>

        <p class="intro">I grew up in the small town of Waxhaw, North Carolina, just outside the bustling city of Charlotte. Although I loved the quiet charm of my hometown, I quickly grew to dislike the chaos and heavy traffic of the city whenever I visited. Those experiences made me appreciate the peaceful life in Waxhaw even more.</p>
        
        <p>At the age of 15, I got my first job at Dominos Pizza, which taught me the value of hard work and responsibility. Unfortunately, during this time, I broke my ankle skateboarding, which sidelined me from delivering pizzas. <span class="sentence">A regular customer, who I often gave discounts to, took pity on my situation and suggested I try IT for his company in the city.</span> That opportunity changed everything for me.</p>
        
        <p>In 2014, I did a one-day trial run at the customers company and was hired as a part-time intern the very next day. That role sparked my career in IT and opened doors I never imagined. Fast forward to today, and I now work in cybersecurity as a Threat Detection Engineer, with a decade of experience in the IT industry. Its been an incredible journey of growth and learning.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work, my hobbies revolve around spending quality time with my family and exploring the latest advancements in technology. Both give me a sense of purpose and excitement as I continue to pursue new challenges and opportunities.</p>
